Challenges and issues I could not solve:
    1. Storing local data after closing an app. E.g. storing new movies cells added by user. I tried using UserDefaults and conform my Movie class to protocols NSObject, NSCoding, but it did not work out. I understood that I have to archive all the data, but I did not understand how to implement it. Maybe, is it better to store data in a database? I also tried Core Data, but it was hard so I gave up.
    2. AutoLayout, constraints. I have two labels in each row, so I have to get my second label wrap its text onto the next row, but it wraps like this:
    3. Warning message if there are no movies in our list after unknown movie typed. I used UIAlertController, but in your example as far as I understood you used segue to another ViewController, did not you? So, I don't know whether UIAlertController is good alternative or not in this case.
    4. For searching movies I am using another array filteredMoviesArray where I store filtered list of movies and then use it. It seems like it is working.
    5. Please, feel free to leave all possible comments & suggestions & advices & helps :) Thanks :)
